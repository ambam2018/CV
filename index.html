   <p>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in May,2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Management. I come from a family of ten children, all of which, were adopted from different countries around the world. Growing up with a very large, diverse family helps me to connect easily with people; especially those with unique backgrounds. This has helped me thrive in my cosmetologist profession for over five years. I enjoy reading, figure skating, and volunteering at summer camps during my spare time. I enjoyed working with young adults and developing new themes and games with my group of counselors to help make the camps successful.
   For two academic semesters, I was an HR recruiter intern for Speedway LLC. There I sourced associate and management level candidates. I ran background checks, onboarded, and interviewed candidates to find the best possible fit for our stores.The internship included working alongside region recruiters, region operations managers, and the senior human resources advisor for a well rounded training experience. It also required me to understand and utilize various software for setting appointments, reviewing candidate qualifications, and reviewing reports. From this exposure, I learned that I enjoy working with employee relations and internal communications. I am familiar in working in teams and varying environments due to my experience as a cosmetologist and a variety of customer service positions. While working in these positions, I have learned to provide excellent customer service in collaboration with other professionals.
   My ideal job position would be to work as a human resource generalist since I find managing company-employee communication, employee development, and the logistics of recruiting and staffing engaging. After graduating I intend to seek out further human resource certification to continue advancing my skill in this area
